    <p class="bio">My first name is actually William, but I go by my middle name, Brady. One of my favorite things to do is rock climb. I have been climbing for about 6 years and wish I could go more often. 
    I did one semester at PVCC (Piedmont Virginia Community College) then stumbled upon this bootcamp and decided I wanted to go for it.
    I am now hoping to finish this course and find a full time job in development!
    At some point, I would like to be a game video game developer as this has always been a dream of mine. I think a good place to start (on my own time after this bootcamp) would be developing mobile applications and games as those are typically a lot less graphically involved.
    </p>
    <p class="bio">Another hobby of mine is skateboarding, which I have been doing since I was about 7 years old(I dont know how all of my bones are in tact).
        You could say I like a good challenge, which is why this course will be a good fit for me. If I am not being challenged, I get incredibly bored.
